title: KENNEDY DRAKE
content: Kennedy Drake (b.1999) is a Bradford-born and based artist, who
  received a first-class BA Hons in Visual Arts at Bradford School of Art and a
  distinction in MFA Fine Art at Sheffield Hallam University. Her work is
  focused on inequalities and working-class culture, largely drawing from
  autobiographical experience. Using paint, print and the process of upcycled
  everyday textiles, her work presents a cutting critique on modern British
  society, including the cost-of-living crisis which is engulfing society and
  pushing the poorest further into financial difficulty. More recently, Drake
  has started to consider the ideas of hope and progression towards peace,
  looking to nature as inspiration.
